# MathQuiz
This project presents a Math Quiz Game mobile application developed using MIT App Inventor. The application aims to make math learning more engaging by transforming it into a game-based experience. Users can log in to the app and answer randomly generated questions covering basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In addition to taking quizzes, users can view their scores, search results by quiz type, delete their entries, and view their average time taken to complete quizzes.
The application provides a simple yet effective learning tool for students, parents, and teachers. It offers students a fun and interactive way to practice math skills, assists teachers support classroom learning, and enables parents to monitor and support their children's learning progress at home.
